This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a modern implementation of Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) for cross-domain graph neural network transfer learning, featuring **Dynamic Performance-Based Anchor Selection**. The project focuses on learning transferable representations across different graph datasets using contrastive pretraining, SVD feature alignment, and novel dynamic anchor-based regularization.

### Key Innovation: Dynamic Anchor Selection

Unlike traditional static anchor methods (e.g., MoG-based), this implementation features:
- **Performance-driven anchor selection**: High-performing nodes serve as reference anchors
- **Dynamic adaptation**: Anchor quality improves during training
- **Source-free operation**: No dependency on source domain data
- **Self-supervised discovery**: Target domain provides its own reference signals

## Key Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Experiments
```bash
# Single cross-domain experiment with dynamic anchors
python train_pretrain.py    # Pretrain encoder on source dataset
python train_fine_tuning.py # Fine-tune on target with dynamic anchor selection

# Comprehensive evaluation across all dataset pairs
python run_experiments.py   # Runs cross-domain experiments with dynamic vs static anchor comparison

# Debug and validation
python debug_data_check.py     # Verify dataset loading and SVD alignment
python debug_step_by_step.py   # Step-by-step debugging of the pipeline
python debug_anchor_selection.py  # Debug dynamic anchor selection process
```

### Configuration

All experiments are controlled via `config.yaml` with structured validation:

### Selection Criteria Implementation

#### Primary Criterion: Individual Node Loss
```python
def compute_loss_scores(logits, labels, mask):
    """
    Nodes with lower individual loss demonstrate better task alignment
    """
    node_losses = F.cross_entropy(logits, labels, reduction='none')  # [N]
    train_losses = node_losses[mask]
    
    # Invert and normalize: lower loss → higher score
    min_loss, max_loss = train_losses.min(), train_losses.max()
    normalized = (train_losses - min_loss) / (max_loss - min_loss + 1e-8)
    scores = 1.0 - normalized
    
    return scores
```

#### Secondary Criterion: Prediction Confidence
```python
def compute_confidence_scores(logits, mask):
    """
    High confidence predictions indicate stable, reliable representations
    """
    probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=1)
    entropy = -torch.sum(probs * torch.log(probs + 1e-8), dim=1)
    confidence = -entropy  # Lower entropy = higher confidence
    
    train_confidence = confidence[mask]
    
    # Normalize to [0, 1] range
    min_conf, max_conf = train_confidence.min(), train_confidence.max()
    scores = (train_confidence - min_conf) / (max_conf - min_conf + 1e-8)
    
    return scores
```

## Performance Metrics & Validation

### Success Criteria

#### Primary Metrics
- **Downstream Task Accuracy**: 2-5% improvement over static MoG approach
- **Convergence Speed**: 10-20% fewer epochs to reach target performance
- **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Consistent improvements across dataset pairs

#### Quality Metrics
- **Anchor Diversity**: > 0.8 (normalized distance between anchors)
- **Representativeness**: < 0.5 (average distance from nodes to nearest anchor)
- **Selection Stability**: > 70% overlap between consecutive anchor updates

#### Computational Requirements
- **Training Overhead**: < 15% additional time compared to baseline
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal increase with efficient anchor storage
- **Scalability**: Support for graphs with 100k+ nodes

### Experimental Validation

#### Baseline Comparisons
1. **Static MoG Anchors**: Current implementation (primary baseline)
2. **Random Selection**: Random node selection as anchors
3. **Gaussian Prior**: Standard Gaussian anchor generation
4. **No Regularization**: Training without target-centric regularization

#### Test Scenarios
1. **Standard Cross-Domain**: All 20 dataset pair combinations
2. **Limited Labels**: 5-shot, 10-shot learning scenarios
3. **Large Graphs**: Scalability testing on Reddit, ogbn-products
4. **Heterogeneous Graphs**: Non-homophilic graph types

## Development Guidelines

### Adding Dynamic Anchor Components
1. Inherit from appropriate base classes in `core/` directory
2. Follow the established factory pattern for component creation
3. Implement comprehensive logging and error handling
4. Add configuration validation for new parameters
5. Include fallback mechanisms for robustness

### Configuration Management
- Use structured configuration with type validation
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing experiments
- Document all new parameters with clear descriptions
- Provide sensible defaults based on empirical validation

### Testing and Validation
- Implement unit tests for all anchor selection logic
- Add integration tests for training loop compatibility
- Include performance regression tests
- Validate across multiple random seeds for statistical significance

### Error Handling and Fallbacks
- Implement graceful degradation when dynamic selection fails
- Provide clear error messages with suggested solutions
- Log fallback activations for debugging
- Maintain training stability under all conditions

## Research Context

### Problem Statement
Traditional static anchor methods suffer from:
- **Fixed Reference Points**: Anchors don't adapt as model improves
- **Target-Only Modeling**: Logically inconsistent distribution modeling
- **Source Dependency**: Many methods require source domain access

### Innovation Summary
Dynamic Performance-Based Anchor Selection addresses these limitations by:
- Using actual task performance to identify high-quality nodes
- Continuously updating anchor selection as training progresses
- Operating in a completely source-free manner
- Leveraging target domain's intrinsic structure for reference generation

### Expected Research Impact
- **Immediate**: Improved cross-domain transfer performance
- **Medium-term**: New paradigm for adaptive regularization in graph learning
- **Long-term**: Foundation for self-supervised domain adaptation methods
